# Shared Wallet Smart Contract


## 📌 Features
* ****Multi-Owner / Admin-Controlled Wallet Structure:**** Defines a single immutable owner (`i_owner`) who acts as the contract administrator. The owner has exclusive authority to manage permissions and control access. This ensures centralized governance and prevents unauthorized administrative actions. The owner address is permanently fixed at deployment and cannot be modified.
* ****Permission-Based Access Control System:**** Implements a whitelist mechanism using `isPermitted` mapping to track authorized users. Only permitted addresses are allowed to execute restricted functions such as withdrawals. The owner can dynamically grant or revoke permissions. Prevents unauthorized users from interacting with sensitive wallet operations.
* ****Multi-Source ETH Deposit Support:**** Allows the contract to receive ETH through multiple pathways: (i) Explicit deposits via `deposit()` function. (ii) Direct ETH transfers via `receive()` function. (iii) Fallback handling via `fallback()` function. Ensures the wallet can accept funds regardless of transaction format. All deposits emit a `Deposit` event for transparency and tracking.
* ****Automatic ETH Reception Handling:**** Uses Solidity’s `receive()` and `fallback()` functions to automatically accept ETH transfers without requiring function calls. This ensures compatibility with wallets, exchanges, and external contracts that send ETH directly to the contract address. 
* ****Event-Based Transaction Transparency:**** Implements event logging for all major state changes: (i) `Deposit` emitted when ETH is received. (ii) `Withdrawal` emitted when funds are sent out. (iii) `AddressPermitted` emitted when user permissions are updated. (iv) `AllowanceUpdated` emitted when spending limits change. It Provides full on-chain traceability for frontends and analytics tools.
* ****Per-User Allowance / Spending Limit System**** Introduces a custom allowance model using `allowance` mapping. Each permitted user has a predefined withdrawal limit that restricts how much they can withdraw from the contract. This adds a budgeting layer on top of permission control, preventing unlimited fund access even for authorized users.
* ****Controlled Withdrawal Mechanism:**** Implements a secure withdrawal system that enforces multiple checks: (i) User must be marked as permitted.  (ii) Contract must have sufficient ETH balance.  (iii) User must not exceed their allowance.  Allowance is reduced before transfer execution to prevent reentrancy exploits. Ensures funds are only released under strict validation rules.
* ****Reentrancy Attack Protection:**** Uses OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent recursive withdrawal attacks. The `nonReentrant` modifier ensures that no nested withdrawal calls can occur during an active transaction, protecting user funds from exploitation via malicious fallback contracts.
* ****Strict Balance Validation System:**** Before executing withdrawals, the contract verifies that it holds enough ETH to fulfill the request. If the balance is insufficient, the transaction is reverted with a custom error. This prevents overdrafts and ensures safe fund accounting.
* ****Zero Address Validation Safety Layer:**** Prevents assignment of invalid addresses (`address(0)`) in sensitive functions such as permission and allowance updates. This avoids accidental fund locking or misconfiguration caused by invalid Ethereum addresses.
* ****Secure Low-Level ETH Transfers:**** Uses low-level `.call{value: amount}("")` for ETH transfers instead of deprecated `transfer()` or `send()`. This ensures compatibility with contracts requiring higher gas limits while still validating transfer success explicitly.
* ****Custom Error Optimization System:**** Replaces traditional `require()` strings with custom Solidity errors for gas efficiency and clarity. Reduces gas costs and improves debugging precision.
* ****Contract Balance Query System:**** Provides a read-only function `getBalance()` to retrieve the total ETH held by the contract. Enables external applications, dashboards, and users to monitor wallet liquidity without modifying state.
* ****Transparent Administrative Control System:**** All administrative actions (permissions and allowances) emit events, ensuring that changes to user rights and spending limits are fully observable on-chain.
* ****Secure State Mutation Ordering:****
